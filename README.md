# <p align="center">SKY</p>

Sky is a Forge mod for Minecraft that adds a Sky dimension. Weather and daytime pass just like in the Overworld, but absolutely no blocks generate!

You can use Sky to make a spawn map and use command blocks to travel to other dimensions. The sky is yours to paste in your own schematics and structures, or start off from scratch right here!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 8 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Forge-1.16 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/sky.git

cd ./sky

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
