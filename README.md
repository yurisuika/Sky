# [Sky](http://suikacraft.com)

Sky is a Forge mod for Minecraft that adds a Sky dimension. Weather and daytime pass just like in the Overworld, but absolutely no blocks generate!

You can use Sky to make a spawn map and use command blocks to travel to other dimensions. The sky is yours to paste in your own schematics and structures, or start off from scratch right here!

## FEATURES

* Clouds now render at 0. You are in the sky!
* Removed void fade and horizon darkness.
